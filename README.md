# Crosshair Overlay Program

A customizable crosshair overlay for Windows.  
Perfect for gaming, precision work, or just having a visual center point on your screen, it works over any application and I personally use this for games such as Rust and Marvel Rivals

## âœ¨ Features
- **Multiple Crosshair Shapes** â€” Dot, Cross, V-Cross, Circle Dot, T-Hair, Arrow styles, and more (as they get added).
- **Custom Colors & Sizes** â€” Adjust crosshair color, line thickness, center dot size, and more.
- **Click-Through Overlay** â€” Stays on top of all windows without blocking mouse input.
- **Theme Support** â€” Switch between multiple color themes for the GUI.
- **Shape Preview Selector** â€” Visual menu for picking your crosshair shape.
- **Persistent Settings** â€” All preferences saved between launches.
